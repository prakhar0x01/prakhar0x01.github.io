>Masculinity encompasses more than just traditional roles and traits. It's about taking responsibility, leading, and evolving. This guide explores what masculinity means today, the traits associated with it, and how it contrasts with feminine roles and energy.

### What is Masculinity? 

   - Frame of taking on the traditional role of men on a social level.
   - Mindset to approach the world.
   - Useful for social networking/problem solving.
   - Taking responsibility.
   - Mission-oriented.
   - The protector.
   - The provider.
   - The leader.

### Traits of Masculinity:

   - **Strength:** Take responsibility and do it for others.
   - **Sacrifice**
   - **Discipline**
   - **Endurance**

1. **What about bitches and cars?**

   - Marketing tool/strategy.

2. **Is the point to be the most masculine person ever?**

   - No, grow from a boy into a man, i.e., evolve.

3. **Can women take a masculine role?**

   - Yes, they can and they must (at the workplace).
   - E.g., "Feminism."

4. **Should men take a feminine role?**

   - Yes, it feels alive.

5. **Is there a biological component to masculinity?**

   - Yes, men are more biologically masculine than women.
   - It also depends on environment and exposure.

6. **Is there such a thing as masculine energy?**

   - Yes, but it is more about the brain (because mindset influences energy).

7. **Why is there a problem with modern masculinity?**

   - Your parents and school raised you to focus completely on yourself. Then Twitter/Instagram makes you focus on yourself, i.e., a narcissistically driven society, constantly comparing you and telling you to look at yourself, presenting yourself in stories and reels, and portraying yourself as the smartest person. It is some kind of scene from a movie; it's not even self-reflection, it is self-objectification.

9. **Difference between masculinity and femininity:**

    - **Masculinity :** What needs/supposed to be done?
    - **Femininity :** What needs to be lived in it (what is happening to me, how much I experience)?


### Conclusion
> Masculinity is more than just traditional roles; it's about evolving, taking responsibility, and embracing various aspects of both masculine and feminine energies. Understanding these dynamics can help you navigate your personal growth and societal expectations more effectively.
