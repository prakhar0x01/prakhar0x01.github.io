> Motivation drives our actions and decisions in various ways. From societal expectations to personal ambitions, understanding the different aspects of motivation can help you channel it effectively. This guide explores the philosophy and psychology behind motivation and offers insights into overcoming common challenges.

### Society Definition:
- Propels you to action in a specific direction.
- Eg. School --> Good College --> Good Job --> Marriage --> Kids --> Trips, etc.

### Internet Definition:
- Propels you to do things that matter.
- Eg. Things which are serious (mostly) like doing workouts, trading, going hard, etc.

### Prakhar Gupta Definition:
- Propels you to actions, whatever the action may be, even the worst.
- Motivation is completely an internal drive; it is a biopsychological phenomenon.
- Eg. Bunking classes to chill, thinking constantly about sex or pornographic content.

### Motivation : PUBG v/s Your Life 

- Game with start & end.
- Game with victory.
- Certain understanding.
- Requires you to win sometimes.
- Play against equally competent people.
- Sharing experiences with people.

### Science [[Sapolsky's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sapolsky) Monkey Experiment]

1. Motivation is in anticipation of reward (not exactly the reward).
2. There needs to be a fixed game.
3. Monkey needs to understand the game (Mastery).
4. Need an element of 'Maybe' (50% more motivation than anticipation).

- This is the reason internet motivational speakers are doing so well; they make normal users (at least for a second/day/week) think that they might get what they're going after. This is the entire phenomenon of Internet Motivation.
- They create an image that 'you can do it' and paint a story of how you will feel. As a result, your brain processes it continuously through mirror neurons for a day or a week and then it disappears.

### Why Aren't You Motivated?

- Imagine a second that occupies your head, that one thing you want to do but do not have enough motivation to do it. Think about it.
- So the difference between PUBG and the thing you want to do is:

  1. In PUBG, the game is clear, but in your case, life is not clear! So either most people live their life on someone else's blueprint or they just let circumstances beat them.
  2. In PUBG, you desire to play, but in your case, you operate under pressure, not desires.
  3. In PUBG, there is a fixed time to get feedback, but in your case, it is a too-long feedback loop. As a result, people start losing interest, and then a new game comes out, i.e., Distractions.
  4. Distractions --> People are more interested in the consequences of their actions than the actions themselves.
     
- Eg. If you were not respected in your childhood, and now you have friends who respect you but are too much into parties and chilling, on the other hand, there is another option to get respect by doing UPSC. So, by default, you're more interested in 'getting respected' than the option or the way you get it.

### Mind-Altering Perspectives on Motivation

1. **INSPIRATION**

- When you talk to someone, one of the functions that you accomplish is to understand the model of reality they inhabit. You try to understand how they pieced out different parts of life and how they can fit those parts so that you could repeat the same.
- Eg. [Eklavya's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekalavya) Story.
- Sometimes the problem is not having motivation; sometimes the problem is that you do not have the map of the problem, i.e., inspiration.
- The majority of people are living an NPC life, where they just blindly follow trends and want to escape from what they have instead of admitting what they have.

2. **MOTIVATION**

- Define motivation as excellence, not success.
- Eg. In *3 Idiots*, Raju is running behind success (family pressure) whereas Rancho is running behind excellence.

  - So, under family pressure, Raju becomes so blinded that he puts multiple rings on his hands, bargains results from God rather than actually worshiping, and has no freedom, submission, or surrender in life.
  - Whereas Rancho feels so much independence, freedom, and submission in his pursuit.
  - Hence, Rancho says to Raju, "Do not run after success; instead, run after excellence!"

- Orient yourself towards excellence, define yourself in terms of excellence, and you’ll do much better. Because then you’re not acting under outside pressure; you’re internally submitted/surrendered.

3. **TRACKS**

- Every meaningful thing requires confusion, effort, and sacrifices.
- Quote by Harmozi:

  > - "What you cannot measure, you cannot predict; what you cannot predict, you cannot beat."

- So, track your progress by splitting your end goals journey into multiple short goals and start acting upon them.
- You need discipline, consistency, and the ability to overcome your urges to avoid boring work.
- In conclusion, if you're not disciplined enough, you're not strong!

4. **DETERMINATION**

- It’s a play of strength.
- Things happen in life with no regard to what you want --> Breakups, deaths, parties, loss, distractions, conflicts.
- Determination is the test of your character, and you shouldn't give up!
- Every time you get bored of doing that stuff, push yourself double that day. Very simply said.


### Conclusion
> Understanding motivation involves recognizing its different dimensions—from societal expectations to personal drives. By focusing on excellence, tracking progress, and building determination, you can harness motivation more effectively and overcome common obstacles.
