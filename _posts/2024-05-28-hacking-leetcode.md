  While most people use LeetCode to sharpen their problem-solving skills, I took a different route‚Äîdigging into its logic. In this blog, I‚Äôll walk you through how I found and responsibly reported three impactful business logic vulnerabilities in LeetCode‚Äôs main application - [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/). Each case involved clever misuse of logic, and none required complex technical exploits. Just pure understanding of how things shouldn't work.

### üß© Case 1: Infinite Redemptions with Limited LeetCoins

##### üìå Description

LeetCode offers a store where users can redeem items using "leetcoins." Logically, if you have 70 leetcoins, you should only be able to redeem one item worth that amount. But due to race condition vulnerabilities, I was able to redeem multiple items with the same coin balance.

##### üí• Exploit Summary

By intercepting the redemption request and launching it concurrently using Turbo Intruder, I was able to bypass redemption limits.

##### üõ† Steps to Reproduce

- Start with 70 leetcoins.
- Intercept the redemption request via any proxy tools.
- Send it to Turbo Intruder with this script:

```python
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,
                           concurrentConnections=50,
                           requestsPerConnection=50,
                           pipeline=False)

    for i in range(50):
        engine.queue(target.req, target.baseInput, gate='race1')

    engine.openGate('race1')
    engine.complete(timeout=60)

def handleResponse(req, interesting):
    table.add(req)
```


- Execute and observe‚Äîmultiple items get redeemed.

  overflow: hidden;
  max-width: 100%;
}

.video-container iframe {
  position: absolute;

</div>


##### üéØ Impact

- Bypasses monthly limits (e.g. more than 3 time-travel tickets).
- Can be extended to perks or premium subscriptions.
- Financial implications for LeetCode.

### üîì Case 2: Free Access to Premium Content

##### üìå Description

LeetCode offers premium problems with paid access. However, using a clever frontend trick, I was able to access premium descriptions, discussions, and solutions.

##### üõ† Steps to Reproduce

- Use a non-premium account.
- Visit any premium problem (e.g. **[Word-Squares](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-squares/)**).
- Intercept and modify the response‚Äîset all parameters to true except **`"isPaidOnly": false`**.
- To reveal the problem description: Add a note to the problem.
- Go to your notes section and enable **"Show Description."**

<style>
.video-container {
  position: relative;
  padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 aspect ratio */
  height: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  max-width: 100%;
}

.video-container iframe {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
</style>
<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-p11kuCin0?si=gZABuinMSMl8mqcm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


##### üéØ Impact

- Unauthorized viewing of premium content.
- Could lead to public leaks and financial damage.
- Involves only frontend manipulation‚Äîno backend auth.

### ü™ô Case 3: Free LeetCoins via Profile Update Race Condition

##### üìå Description

By editing basic profile info (like name or gender) concurrently, I triggered a condition where the application granted leetcoins multiple times for a single update.

##### üõ† Steps to Reproduce

- Create a LeetCode account.
- Go to the Edit Profile section.
- Intercept the request and send it to Turbo Intruder.
- Use this script:

```python
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,
                           concurrentConnections=50,
                           requestsPerConnection=50,
                           pipeline=False)

    for i in range(50):
        engine.queue(target.req, target.baseInput, gate='race1')

    engine.openGate('race1')
    engine.complete(timeout=60)

def handleResponse(req, interesting):
    table.add(req)
```

- Set **`HTTP/1.1`** to **`HTTP/1.0`** and mark **`%s`** appropriately.
- Execute and refresh the profile page ‚Äî> extra coins added.


<style>
.video-container {
  position: relative;
  padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 aspect ratio */
  height: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  max-width: 100%;
}

.video-container iframe {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
</style>
<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q2Fp18B1-Hs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


##### üéØ Impact

- Generation of coins beyond permitted logic.
- Can be used to buy perks or affect user rankings.
- Again, financial damage for the platform.

---

#### üîç Takeaways
- Business logic flaws are powerful. They exploit what the app allows‚Äînot what it protects.
- Race conditions can occur in unexpected places. Backend validation is a must.
- Always check what a user is allowed to do logically, not just technically.

##### My Personal thought to LeetCode and Security Researchers ...
1. **For Security Researchers :** Please do not try to perform security research on leetcode infrastructure. My overall experience with this team is horrible and they offer leetcoins as a return of your investment. So don't expect anything in return.

2. **For LeetCode :** Very unprofessional - Dev/Sec Team take huge time to resolve a case (~ 6 months) , Company did not offer any LoA, Swags or anything to security researcher who helped them from a major financial loss. If I want, I can mine millions of leetcoins easily and make a lot of money by unethically selling them or redeeming any swags/goodies, well it's leetcode...!! (Very Disappointing)
